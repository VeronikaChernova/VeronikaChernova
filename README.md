Hi, I am a Front-end Developer with 7 years of experience in building and maintaining complex web applications. My expertise includes custom forms, visualizing satellite data on maps and charts, NFT marketplaces, crypto wallet integration with smart contract payments, generative AI-powered websites, and Three.js data visualization. I have experience working in Agile and Kanban environments, using Jira and Asana for task tracking, and guiding a team of front-end developers. My primary expertise is in creating and maintaining Angular applications, but I have also built a Telegram tap game using React.js, learning Next.js.
